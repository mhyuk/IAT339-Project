      <h5>About Project_RC</h5>

      <div class="container2">
      <h3>What does the company do, or offer?</h3>
      <p>Project_RC is a niche, fashion e-boutique for digital-savvy, young women who want to update
        their wardrobes with fresh ways to express their creative identities. The first launch will
        specialize in a collection of novelty, statement accessories.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="container2">
        <h3>Who is the company to potential customers?</h3>
<p>Young women who are digital-savvy shoppers and both a follower and arbiter of fashion on
  social media, particularly Instagram. A small, early fanbase consisting of global customers primarily from Canada, United States,
  Australia, and Europe.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="container2">
        <h3>Why might this company entice someone to purchase a product or service?</h3>
        <p>A niche fashion identity driven by styling and content creation / curation – a creative know-how
          which cannot be copied easily by competitors. The way Project_RC will communicate with audiences, specifically through social media,
          takes a hybrid influencer-retail strategy that is different from typical retail social media. This
          means that the content Project_RC promotes is not strictly limited to our business. Instead,
          the primary goal of our communication strategy is to share content that makes an emotional
          impact on our target audience. The goal is to show how style is a holistic expression of who you
          are as a person, not just the items you wear.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="container2">
        <h3>Value Proposition</h3>
        <p>We believe that young women should be inspired by and have access to unique fashion items
          to confidently express their creative identities. Through Project_RC’s ability to create inspiring
          digital content and offer quality products at affordable prices, young women can discover what
          style truly means.</p>
