		For children of the parent 'flexbox', it is good practice to set a 'flex' property. This is a shorthand in which we in fact set three values, of 'flex-grow', 'flex-shrink' and 'flex-basis' accordingly. In our CSS, this will look like

		flex: flex-grow flex-shrink flex-basis;

		flex-grow - Defines the ability for an element to 'grow' into extra space as needed.
		flex-shrink - Defines the ability for an element to 'shrink' as needed.
		flex-basis - Defines the default size of an element before distributing space, can be based on existing height or width.

		Both 'flex-grow' and 'flex-shrink' can be effectively thought as 'weights': For example elements with higher flex-grow weights - such as a value of 2 in a set of elements with weights of 1 - will try and take up more space when available. When the space is not available, the flexbox will compress those items as necessary.

		In the example below, we are setting both the ability of elements to grow and shrink as equal (all 1), and we are telling the default size to pay attention to the element's set default sizing.
