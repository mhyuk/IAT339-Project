        <h1>Customer-oriented Service</h1>
        <section class="element">
        <div class="text-about">
          <p>Young women who are digital-savvy shoppers and both a follower and arbiter of fashion on
            social media, particularly Instagram. A small, early fanbase consisting of global customers primarily from Canada, United States,
            Australia, and Europe.</p>
          <p>Project_RC is a niche fashion identity driven by styling and content creation / curation – a creative know-how
            which cannot be copied easily by competitors. The way Project_RC will communicate with audiences, specifically through social media,
            takes a hybrid influencer-retail strategy that is different from typical retail social media. This
            means that the content Project_RC promotes is not strictly limited to our business. Instead,
            the primary goal of our communication strategy is to share content that makes an emotional
            impact on our target audience. The goal is to show how style is a holistic expression of who you
            are as a person, not just the items you wear.</p>
